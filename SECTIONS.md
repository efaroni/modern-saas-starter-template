# SaaS Template - Development Sections

## Overview

7 development sections that demonstrate all essential SaaS functionality with mock-first, real-when-ready approach.

## Section 1: Configuration

**Purpose:** API key management + secure database storage testing
**Route:** `/dev/config`
**Features:**

- User API key management (OpenAI, Stripe, etc.)
- Secure database storage testing (encryption, hashing)
- Real-time connection testing
- Service status indicators (✅ Connected, ❌ Invalid, ⚠️ Not configured)
- Database CRUD for API keys (create, read, update, delete)
- Integration health dashboard

**Database Tables:** `user_api_keys`

## Section 4: Email System

See Section_4_TODOS.md

**Database Tables:** `email_logs`, `email_preferences`

## Section 5: AI Styling System

**Purpose:** Screenshot analysis + 3-file code generator (STYLE_GUIDE.md, tailwind.config.js, globals.css)
**Route:** `/dev/styling`
**Features:**

- Screenshot upload interface (1-3 reference images)
- OpenAI Vision with Vercel AI SDK analysis of design patterns and preferences
- Three-file code generator with copy/paste outputs:
  1. STYLE_GUIDE.md - AI-readable design patterns and brand guidelines
  2. tailwind.config.js - Custom theme configuration with extracted colors/styles
  3. app/globals.css - CSS variables and custom styling
- Clear file modification instructions (exactly where to paste each code block)
- Live preview of generated styling on sample components
- Instant custom branding - escape generic ShadCN look

**Database Tables:** `style_configs` (for saving user preferences)

## Section 6: AI Site Assistant

**Purpose:** AI provider abstraction + context system + function calling foundation
**Route:** `/dev/ai`
**Features:**

- AI provider abstraction layer (easy to swap OpenAI → Anthropic → specialized models)
- Vercel AI SDK integration (streaming chat, function calling, context injection)
- Extensible context system (app info, navigation, user state)
- Function calling foundation (framework for AI actions)
- Template test queries ("Tell me about this app", "What can I do here?")
- Easy customization framework (forks can add app-specific context)
- Multi-model support ready (different AI for different tasks)
- Usage tracking and rate limiting (provider-agnostic billing)
- Foundation for AI agents (structure for future AI actions)

**Database Tables:** `ai_conversations`, `ai_usage_logs`

## Section 7: Deployment & CI/CD

**Purpose:** GitHub Actions + Vercel + database migration + production readiness
**Route:** `/dev/deployment`
**Features:**

- GitHub Actions workflow templates (test + deploy on branch push)
- Vercel configuration with environment-specific settings
- Database migration strategy (Neon dev → Neon prod scaling)
- Environment validation (connectivity testing for all services)
- Branch-based deployment (dev → staging → production)
- CI/CD abstraction layer (easy to swap GitHub Actions → GitLab CI)
- Deployment readiness checklist (pre-deploy validation)
- Configuration artifact generator (copy/paste deployment configs)

**Files Generated:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `vercel.json`, migration scripts

## Development Order

1. **Foundation:** Database setup, basic app structure, routing
2. **Core Sections:** Configuration → Auth → Payments
3. **Advanced Features:** Email → AI Styling → AI Assistant
4. **Production:** Deployment setup and testing

## Mock-First Approach

Every section works immediately without API keys:

- Mock responses for all external services
- Real functionality when proper credentials added
- Clear status indicators showing mock vs real mode
- Seamless upgrade path from testing to production
